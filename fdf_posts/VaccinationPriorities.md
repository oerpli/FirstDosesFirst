# Goal of the vaccination program
Currently, people are dying and large parts of Europe have considerably restricted what inhabitants are allowed to do, to prevent even more people from dying. 

Considering this, one might think that some effort has been spent on fixing this situation as soon as possible. Alas, this is not the case.

## Why do we vaccinate? Who should be vaccinated? 
This is very basic stuff. If you have even a basic grasp of the topic, feel free to skip this.

The point of a vaccination program is to reduce the impact of an illness that would otherwise be pretty severe.
There are a few ways to achieve progress towards that goal:
- Vaccinate enough people s.t. the illness doesn't spread any more 
- Vaccinate those people that have a high chance of being exposed to the pathogen 
- Vaccinate those people that are at risk of having a severe course of disease


For example, if an illness kills people born on February 29th but doesn't affect others, it's likely advisable to vaccinate the â‰ˆ0.07% of the population born on a Feb 29th first.
If the outbreak was on the International Space Station, scientists in Antarctica might get away without vaccination even if they are born on a leap-day.

COVID-19 isn't known to have any special effects based on day of birth, but year of birth (=age) seems to be important (the CDC estimates the fatality risk of an 80y old person to be about 7800x increased compared to a 20y old person).
Furthermore, people in certain occupations, such as doctors, nurses, teachers have a higher chance to catch the virus compared to data scientists that sit in their home office all day.
For this reason, most vaccinations programs prioritize the following groups, roughly in this order:
- People with some political influence
- Friends of people with some political influence
- People with increased risk of having a severe disease
- People with increased risk of being infected due to their occupation

## Why did Europe fail so hard?

Our leaders follow bureaucrats to cover their own asses, our bureaucrats are innumerate idiots (as one would expect) and our academics are the most [pathetic](https://medicalethicshealthpolicy.med.upenn.edu/faculty-all/steven-joffe) and [useless](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776229) group of herd-thinkers imaginable.

Usually one could hope that the fourth estate holds the other dickheads accountable. Sadly this is not the case as they are more concerned with important things such as:
- Making fun of/being angry about the few idiots even dumber than the median journalist (antivaxxers, flat earthers, ...)
- Towing the party line and not ask any questions that would undermine trust in "the experts" (else the previously mentioned idiots might feel confirmed in their suspicions)
