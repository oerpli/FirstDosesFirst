# Analysis

## 1st Approach
My initial approach was to just to  the following:
- Estimate the daily level of immunization resulting from both, a 1D and 2D vaccination program
- Estimate resulting deaths from either of them


|                |     1D |     2D |   Benefit 1D |
|:---------------|-------:|-------:|-------------:|
| Austria        |   4800 |   4816 |           16 |
| United Kingdom |  62743 |  63413 |          670 |
| United States  | 243187 | 245197 |         2010 |
