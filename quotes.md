# Some quotes, to be incorporated:

> It’s becoming clearer that delaying the second dose is the right strategy but it was the right strategy back in December when I first started advocating for First Doses First. Waiting for more data isn’t “science,” it’s sometimes an excuse for an unscientific status-quo bias.

> Additionally the UK evaluated all data regarding the new COVID-19 vaccines and what we historically know from other vaccines that the chances of an initial one-jab strategy were extremely high almost to a point where it would be irresponsible to not first vaccinate as many people with one jab as possible. For once the UK put science and common sense above red tape and nationalistic rhetoric unlike many leaders in the EU like Macron or Ursula Von Der Leyen.
